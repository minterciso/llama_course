    "Now that we have a way of utilizing memory, we can start testing with some prompt engineering techniques. There are tons of different techniques, but we'll try to focus on 3 main techniques in order to try and achieve best results, namelly:\n",
    "1. Zero Shot: Basically what we did on the beginning, were we just ask the LLM without providing any type of context.\n",
    "2. Functioning Shot: Like the Zero Shot, but we provide some context to the LLM as to what it should respond as (ie: a developer, consultant, doctor, etc). We already made this before when utilizing the system message.\n",
    "3. Few Shots: We provide the LLM with some extra steps (human interaction) until we finally achieve the final answer we actually need. This is one of the most common techniques when dealing with generic chatbots, and humans are used to utilize this withouth even knowing it.\n",
    "4. Chain of tought: We provide the LLM with small and discrete tasks, until we achieve the final interation.\n",

While it's difficult to pinpoint a single \"top\" language, I can give you an overview of the most popular and in-demand programming languages based on various sources such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and industry trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are my top 5 picks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the king of client-side scripting and has become the de facto language for web development. Its versatility, dynamic nature, and widespread adoption make it an essential skill for any developer. With frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript is used in a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to desktop software.\n",
      "2. **Python**: Python is a versatile language that has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries. It's widely used in data science, machine learning, web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), and automation. Its ease of use and large community make it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.\n",
      "3. **Java**: Java is a popular language that has been around for decades. Its platform independence, strong security features, and vast ecosystem make it a favorite among enterprise developers. It's widely used in Android app development, web development (with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate), and desktop applications.\n",
      "4. **C++**: C++ is a high-performance language that's still widely used in systems programming, game development, and high-performance computing. Its low-level memory management capabilities make it an excellent choice for building efficient, scalable, and reliable software systems.\n",
      "5. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve code maintainability and scalability. It's gaining popularity in the web development community, especially with frameworks like Angular and React. Its compatibility with JavaScript and large community make it an attractive choice for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honorable mentions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Go**: A modern language developed by Google that's gaining traction in cloud computing, networking, and distributed systems.\n",
      "* **Rust**: A systems programming language that prioritizes safety and performance, with a growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.\n",
      "* **Kotlin**: A modern language for Android app development that offers null safety features and interoperability with Java.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the best language to learn is the one that aligns with your goals, interests, and career aspirations. As a seasoned developer, I'm always excited to explore new languages and technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations!\n"
